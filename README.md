# Employee Team Generator

## Description
This application allows users to input employee information such as the employee's name, email, and id, then generates cards based on information given.

## Installation
First, head over to your terminal then input the command 'node index.js'. This will require node to be installed (which you can do by typing in 'npm i' into your terminal as soon as the application loads) which we have provided for you in the packages.json file. After running the index.js command, start inputting employee information and follow the prompts in your terminal. After all is said and done, head over to your 'index.html' file in the 'dist' folder, and open that bad boy up! You should see some beautiful work.

## Usage
Used for companies wanting to keep track of their employees in a virtual setting
